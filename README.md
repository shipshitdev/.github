**For indie developers and wanna-be vibe coders who want to learn how to code with AI and launch a business at the age of AI birth.**

</div>

## 🎯 What We Do

We're an **education hub** that teaches vibe coding—the art of building in a state of flow using AI assistants. We educate through authentic content (live streams, tutorials, The Ship Sh!t Show) while using our own tools as proof of concept.

**Core Formula:** Education Hub → Tools as Proof → Distribution as Monetization

### Our Mission

We serve developers who **can code whatever they want** but need guidance on what they **SHOULD** build. We focus on:

- 🎓 **Learning Value** - Every build teaches something valuable
- 💼 **Business Potential** - What's worth building for revenue?
- 🎨 **Portfolio Building** - Showcase your skills effectively
- ⚡ **Time Efficiency** - Vibe coding is fast, but time is precious
- 🎯 **Vibe Alignment** - Build what matches your style and goals

## 🎯 Our Philosophy

> **"You can code whatever you want. We help you code what you SHOULD."**

We believe vibe coders have the power to build anything with AI assistants. The real question isn't "Can you build it?"—it's "Should you build it?" We help answer that by focusing on learning value, business potential, portfolio building, and vibe alignment.
